# Hangman Game
This is an interactive hangman game implemented in Jupyter Notebook by Python. This game picks random words for you to guess. It is designed for you to input a variety of characters until you guess the correct word. You are given 10 chances to guess the correct word, each time you put a character in and it is wrong, the number of chances you have will go down by one, otherwise every correct character you put will not dedcut the amount of chances you are given. Good luck!
